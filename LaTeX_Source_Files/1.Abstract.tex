The bankruptcy prediction is always one of the hottest topics in economics. A lot of statistical analysis has been made in the solving this problem. However, as far as we know, a very less amount of research is available in solving this problem using Artificial Intelligence (eg. Neural Nets, SVMs, Decision Trees etc). In this paper, we propose a Neural Network based approach to solve this problem. We design our network using Net2Net technique. We achieve an AUC value above 0.920 for all the five different dataset. In the end we compare the Net2Net trained network with a conventionally trained network of the same structure.
