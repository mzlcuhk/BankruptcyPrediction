\section{Conclusions and Future Work}
%Briefly summarize the key findings your paper and point out interesting directions for future inquiry.

In this paper we show that the neural networks can be used for predictions related to the financial state of the companies with high AUC score. We also show that knowledge of one of the year's could be used to learn a model for other years. To best of our knowledge, the model presented in this paper is among the best performing kernel on this dataset. 

For future works we propose to approach this problem as an anomaly detection problem where the companies with safe functioning are non-anomalous. This approach will be able to deal with the skew class issue. Also, we feel that this problem might be able to red-flag any other financial issue and not just future bankruptcy.
