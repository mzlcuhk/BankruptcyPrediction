High AUC score for year 2,3,4 and 5 for the Net2Net in Table \ref{tab:compare} signifies that the data has some correlation over different years, thus utilizing the information learnt about the two classes during year1 helps in learning for subsequent years. 

We conducted experiments by chopping the year1 network at layer 7,6,5 and 4. We obtained best results for the years 2, 3, 4 and 5 when we chop at layer4. An intuition for this could be that the features learnt in layer5 and onwards of network 1 were highly specific to year1 which did not contribute much to the other years. But the features learnt till layer 4 were generic to all the years.
